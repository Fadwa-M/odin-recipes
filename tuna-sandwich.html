        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is one of my favourite light snacks because of how light yet delicious it is. It's super quick to prepare, too,
            so it's easy to prepare anytime.

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                 <li>A pair of toast slices.</li>
                 <li>One can of tuna.</li>
                 <li>Black pepper.</li>
                 <li>One small lemon.</li>
             </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat up the two slices of toast. I avoid toasting it on the stove with butter because I like my Sandwich
                    to be light.
                </li>
                <li>Evenly spread the can of tuna on one slice.</li>
                <li>Add black pepper to your liking. I love spicy food so I add a few pinches.</li>
                <li>Squeeze the lemon on your tuna to your liking as well. The lemons we have are quite small so I squeeze
                    an entire lemon on my sandwich.
                </li>
                <li>voila! Now you have a quick but easy sandwich to munch on. Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
